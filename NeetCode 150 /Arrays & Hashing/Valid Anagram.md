[Valid Anagram](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/)

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.
So we can make hashmap for each string which will take care of frequency(how many times the character appear) of each character in the string. 
If hashmapA is equal to hashmapB then the strings are anagram.
